		"Content": "<font size='18'><b>Update A 0.3: Quests and Mail-</b></font> New major update for The Unholy Kingdom, October 2021. \n\n\n  <font color='#00cc00'>+</font> The new <b>Quest Expansion</b>, bringing in a quest system more similar to quests in other RPGs, where you complete tasks and get according rewards.\n      <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>- Experience quests: gain experience to complete the quest/task. Experience quests also reward you with more experience once you finish the quest</font>\n      <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>- Enemy slaying quests: eliminate enemies to complete the quest/task.</font>\n      <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>- Dungeon completing quests: complete dungeons to complete the quest/task.</font>\n      <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>- Item Delivery quests: gather items and deliver them to complete the quest/task.</font>\n      <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>- Scouting quests: a more complex type of quest, but here's the deal for now: warp to a certain dungeon which has no lethal enemies and those do not give loot and complete a task given in chat to complete the quest/task. For now, scouting quests are solo quests, meaning you cannot get any help.</font>\n\n  <font color='#00cc00'>+</font> Added <b>Mails</b>, where you'll be notified about news like this and other things, like expiration of quests when you log in, or when you finish quests!\n\nThat's it for this update. We hope you have a fun time with your quests and the next major update is expected to come next month, November 2021!"

From Physical to Magical and Elemental damage, we now have it all.\n    <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>-<b>Physical damage</b> is what you'll see in most occasions, and is countered by Armor.</font>\n    <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>-<b>Magical damage</b> is countered by Resistance.</font>\n    <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>-<b>True damage</b> ignores ALL armor from an enemy or player.</font>\n    <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>-<b>Earth damage</b> is countered by Armor + Earth Resistance, is weakened by Fire Resistance and is stronger against Air</font>\n    <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>-<b>Air damage</b> is countered by Armor + Air Resistance, is weakened by Earth Resistance and is stronger against Water</font>\n    <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>-<b>Profane damage</b> is countered by Armor + Profane Resistance, and all Profane Resistance is nullified by Holy Resistance</font>\n    <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>-<b>Water damage</b> is countered by Resistance + Water Resistance, is weakened by Air Resistance and is stronger against Fire</font>\n    <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>-<b>Fire damage</b> is countered by Resistance + Fire Resistance, is weakened by Water Resistance and is stronger against Earth</font>\n    <font color='#ffffff' size='14'>-<b>Holy damage</b> is countered by Armor + Holy Resistance, and all Holy Resistance is nullified by Profane Resistance</font>\n\n  <font color='#00cc00'>+</font> <b>Item Quality</b>: A little buff (or debuff) to your items, ranging from 1 star to 5 stars! Go ahead and brag about getting that 5 star Kendo Stick of yours!\n\n  <font color='#00cc00'>+</font> And finally, <b>The Forge</b>: Used for crafting (crafting recipes included!) and inserting Runes on an item.\n\n  <font color='#00cc00'>+</font> <b>Runes</b>: Now, for something that will get you very excited (and perhaps confused).\n    Ever thought of giving your item all sorts of cool buffs? Hope you're ready for it: all items can have from 1 to 8 runes based on quality. 80% gives you 1 rune slot and every 5% quality increases that by 1 slot.\n    Runes can range from all types of elemental damage (Earth, Air...) and stat boosts!\n\n\nThat's it for this update. Have a good rest of November, see you in December for our final update of 2021!"
