**Note:** 
This source exists for people with developed Flash projects, as the transition to Haxe is much easier.

If you're starting a project from scratch you should use the [Eclipse source code](https://github.com/flut2/eclipse) instead.

**Requirements:**
- A Redis-compatible server running
- Haxe 4.3.6, with the following haxelibs: ``openfl``, ``lime``, ``hxcpp``, ``hxdiscord-rpc`` (haxelib git hxdiscord_rpc https://github.com/MAJigsaw77/hxdiscord_rpc.git).
- C# 9.0
